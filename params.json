It provides also two IDTO interfaces, one empty for all DTOs to use with builders and one with a generic ID (like Frameworks.DAL IEntity) to provide an IEquatable ID to all DTOs you need. DTOBuilders uses IDTO to get DTO parameter and IEntity for Entity parameter, other builders can inherit from BaseBuilder (from Common package)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
